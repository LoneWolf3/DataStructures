/**
 * Oookay I think BFS traversal will work. However for that we would need to
 * convert the file into a graph and then perform the BFS on it.
 * 
 * So the solution would broadly comprise of: A) Convert the file into a graph.
 * Its a one time operation, once done we won't need to do it again. B) Starting
 * with the appropriate node in the graph, perform a BFS(using queues)
