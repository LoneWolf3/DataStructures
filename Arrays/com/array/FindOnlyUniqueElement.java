/**
 * The code works in similar line with the question of
 * "finding the element which appears once in an array - containing other elements each appearing twice"
 * . Solution is to XOR all the elements and you get the answer.
 * 
 * Basically, it makes use of the fact that x^x = 0. So all paired elements get
 * XOR'd and vanish leaving the lonely element.
